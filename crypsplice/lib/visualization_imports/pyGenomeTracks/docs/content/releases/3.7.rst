Enhancements:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This release is full of new tracks and new parameters for existing tracks:

- Brand new tracks:

    - ``fasta``: to display sequences with colored letters from a fasta file (Thanks @GDelevoye for his contribution).

    - ``maf`` (multiple alignment format): to display conservation between species.

    - ``hic_matrix_square``: to display Hi-C matrices not in 'triangle' shape but in 'square' shape.
      This allow to display identical regions but also interactions between 2 different regions.
      This render plots close to `hicPlotMatrix <https://hicexplorer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/hicPlotMatrix.html>`_.

- New parameters for existing tracks:

    - Related to ``hic_matrix_square``: we implemented a new ``display`` mode for ``bed`` and ``links_type`` for ``links``: ``squares``.
      This allow to overlay TADs or loops on these Hi-C maps.

    - For ``bed`` and ``gtf``:
    
        - the ``fontstyle`` can be set to ``italic`` or ``oblique``.
    
        - the ``arrowhead_fraction`` which controls the size of the arrowhead in the flybase style can be adjusted.
    
        - the color of the backbone when you use flybase or UCSC style can be changed with ``color_backbone``.

    - For ``gtf`` a new parameter ``merge_overlapping_exons = true`` help to get a better display when all transcripts are merged. 

    - For ``bedgraph_matrix``: when ``type = lines`` is set the colors of individual lines can be set by ``individual_color`` and the summary line by ``summary_color``

Minor enhancements:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- pyGenomeTracks display better error message when rtf files are used.

- the help message for BED has been improved to highlight the fact that the extension needs to be part of the output.

- if the directory of the output file does not exists, it is created.

Drop support for python 3.6
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The introduction of the new track for Maf forced us to drop support for python 3.6.

Relax version control on matplotlib:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Any version of matplotlib from 3.1.1 to 3.5.1 is now accepted.

Bugfixes:
^^^^^^^^^

- The tick values for the x-axis are now accurate (see `#333 <https://github.com/deeptools/pyGenomeTracks/issues/333>`_) and more informative.

- The y values for tracks like bigwig are not restricted to one decimal. If needed, the scientific notation can be used.

- pyGenomeTracks now allows to plot above chromosome size defined in bigwig or Hi-C matrices without raising an error.

- pyGenomeTracks now works with gtf without exons.

- pyGenomeTracks now closes figures after saving.

- The plotting part does not modify the tracks anymore. This solves `#393 <https://github.com/deeptools/pyGenomeTracks/issues/393>`_
