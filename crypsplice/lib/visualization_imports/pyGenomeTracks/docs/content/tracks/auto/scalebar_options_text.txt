# height of track in cm (ignored if the track is overlay on top the previous track)

# if you want to plot the track upside-down:
# orientation = inverted
# if you want to plot the track on top of the previous track. Options are 'yes' or 'share-y'.
# For the 'share-y' option the y axis values is shared between this plot and the overlay plot.
# Otherwise, each plot use its own scale
#overlay_previous = yes

# color of the scalebar
color = black
# To use transparency, you can use alpha
# default is 1
# alpha = 0.5
# line width:
# line_width = 0.5
# To set the position and the size of the scale bar
# 4 parameters can be set:
# x_center, scalebar_start_position, scalebar_end_position, size
# scalebar_start_position need to be smaller than x_center smaller than scalebar_end_position
# x_center: coordinate where the scale bar should be plotted (center)
# if not set and cannot be deduce from other parameters
# it will be in the middle of the plotted area
#x_center = 3100000
# size: in bp the length of the scale bar
# if not set and cannot be deduced from other parameters
# it will be like in UCSC:
# the higher number that begins with 1, 2 or 5 followed by 0s
# that is less than half the plotted area
#size = 100000
# Another example:
#scalebar_start_position = 2900000
#scalebar_end_position = 3100000
# where: where the size of the scale bar should
# appear among left, right, top, bottom
# default is left
#where = right
# fontsize: default is 12
#fontsize = 10
