# In addition to the maf file the reference genome is required:
# For example
#reference = mm10
# To speed the access to specific region
# The maf file needs an index.
# The default is the file
# followed by '.index'. Alternatively another
# file can be specified.
# If it does not exists it will be created:
#file_index =
# Set colors
#color_identical = black
#color_mismatch = grey
#color_gap = lightgrey
# Set line_width
#line_width = 0.5
# optional: the species order
#species_order = hg18 panTro2
# optional if species_order is specified (don't use space in names)
#species_labels = human chimpanzee
# optional if species_order is specified and they are the only one you want:
#species_order_only = true
# optional if you want to see the DNA sequence of the ref
#display_ref_seq = true
# optional: If not given is guessed from the file ending.
