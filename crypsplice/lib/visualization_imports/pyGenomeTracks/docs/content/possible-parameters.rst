Possible parameters
===================

Here is a table to summarize which are the parameters that can be use for each of the `file_type` and which is the default value:
Empty means this parameter is not used.
``not set`` means that by default the parameter is commented.
This table is available as csv `here <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deeptools/pyGenomeTracks/master/docs/content/all_default_properties.csv>`_.
